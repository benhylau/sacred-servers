When a gofundme is posted, what all is shared within it? What all imbues it, as
its signal is boosted and it goes far beyond the original network. When its goal
is reached, and the possibilities open now in the real-world, is it the same
feeling as an answered prayer? Or a digital artifact of an answered prayer? What
feeling lingers in those that don't reach their goals, what energy remains?

When we make a wish to a well, light a candle and speak our hope, what all comes
along with our voice? What changes when the words are typed instead of said?
Where do these words go?

In talking of the offline world, the question remains rhetoric, or at least the
answer is just beyond our reach.

In the online world, you can give a direct, though, incomplete answer. It is
easy to know where the words go, when typed instead of spoken: they go to
servers.
