Power in Place
}

There are the places and object that feel powerful because I am told they are
powerful, imbued with with belief, tradition, and history. And in these
places, my body responds appropriately-- a reflexive respect that brings my
voice to a whisper in a church, finds me taking off my shoes at the entrance of
a temple, ears pricked up for reverberation in the childhood home of a childhood
hero.

And there are the places and things that hold power for some small, or
inarticulate reason. Or, at least, If i were to try to articualte it, I'd feel
foolish. The one childhood toy I can't let go of, the town I irrationally hate
stopping at when travelling, when an item seems to "call" to me or when one
feels strangely "off". It's as if the things are filled with some energy of the
people before, a loop of time lingering in the space. It's what gives me the
impulse, whenever I move into a new home--no matter how bare, swept, and blank
the new space may be-- to clean it immediately before moving any of my own items
in. What am I cleaning? What invisible thing do I not want mingling with my
own invisible things?
