  Growing online
}

At one point, I considered the internet separate from the world; an imaginary
boundless place. It's likely because, as a kid, my house had dial-up internet,
and to connect to it required a short ritual with arcane sounds. We also had one
phone line, so the internet could not be in the house continually. It was
something you visited late at night, like catching a distant AM station bouncing
down from the sky.

Now, ironically, the internet is something I have to work to get away from. Dig
deep into phone settings to try to keep it from pestering me about new posts I
missed, or to quell the habit of checking work chat in the bathroom, all
stepping out of the shower to scroll through text messages with wet hands. My
evening ritual is to go intentionally offline, shut down the screens and turn
them away, revisit the simplicity of boredom or a book.

The internet and the web still seem imaginary. We keep up the refrain of "This
is not real life", while the things said and done online have direct, tangible
effects in our lives. We see physical media become odd echos of the online
world, newspaper articles detailing the timeline of a particularly important
twitter thread, controversies about upcoming films revealed to be a manufactured
viral campaign. Each day becomes harder to distinguish what's real, whether
online or off.

And we say it is intangible, yet feel the full physical weight of it. The tics
of phone checks, the tired eyes and slumped shoulders, the racing heart or
dopamine rush of a notifying ping. I setup a timer when on the internet now,
have a buzzer  go off every 25 minutes so I remember to get up and stretch
and let my eyes focus softly on some unlit thing. It is to help slow this
imaginary's worlds real, physical effects on me.

We feel the effects of the web, even if they're hard to describe or seem too
obvious to say. What isn't discussed as much is how much we give back to it.
