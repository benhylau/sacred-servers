Another Future

What would happen if we gave as much as we do now, all our vulnerable and
intention-filled requests, but to servers that we owned? Or if we passed our
thoughts directly to one another, amplifying the energy beneath our fingers?

What would happen if we were upfront with the potential energy, the inarticulate
sacred power, that can come from voicing our lives and dreams, and storing the
echoes of this voice...but now it was stored in networks designed to respect,
resonate, and give back to this power?

There is beautiful possibility in decentralized tools because they can be new,
and local, and small. We can create community networks that grow stronger with
each new member, stronger in practical and magical ways, tangible and
intangible. We can have sun-soaked servers, that can be plentiful and small,
held in powerful spots of nature not because of what can be extracted, but
because of what resonates there and what we know can be given back.

We can create tools that are resilient and respectful, respecful of the world
they exist in, the people giving to them, and the streams that passes through it
all. We've felt the tremendous weight of power that profane companies hold over
us. What if we distributed this power among ourselves?

Part of this is poetic metaphor and part of this is me being as literal as I
can, and it can be hard for me to tell sometimes which is which. But that's
alright. I like this liminal space of not knowing.
