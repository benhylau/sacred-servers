 Four Sites of Endless Feeling
}

We've lived with the world wide web for over three decades, and with each year
the amount of places visited online diminishes, while the breadth of activities
we do on them increases considerably. Today, it feels like there's only a
handful of sites, and to these sites w've given the full spectrum of our
emotions.

On sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter we post dumb jokes, sincere
fears, theories about the world, our arguments for the existence of God, and
taco truck reviews. We share art, art that no one sees, art that does well, art
that stays on the platform after the artist is gone, leaving an eerily mundane
final post and a now complete media tab. We announce that we're looking for a
new job, network, share (carefuly edited) casual opinions hoping new eyes are
watching, impressed. We interview, announce new work, and subtly change how we
talk to our friends now that all our bosses are watching. We meet each other,
flirt, ask out, catch up, create worlds of inside jokes with bad reposts, corny
memes, and ironic replies. We fuck, we say I love you, we cheat, we break up, we
block. We painfully linger, with one segment of time on a facebook wall filling
us with memory like it's an old, unwashed shirt. and we stay together, share
apartment photos, merge timelines, announce engagements, plan weddings, share
invites, share baby photos, embarass our child online. We rage, we breakdown, we
organize, we ask for help, we witness and grieve, we scream about inustice into
what feels like a void. We intentionally stay quiet, or speak up, or cowardly
pause over the photo of a burger, afraid that liking it now will be uncaring to
the deep pain being posted above and below it. We ask for medical help, for
places to stay, for funding of our video series or for the surgery we
desperately need. We share something ordinary but know that within it we are
really asking for friendship, safety, an audience, change, to hurt, to be
noticed, for someone to step in, for nostalgic pangs and hoped for futures. We
share cat photos.

We post again and again to the same few platforms, some of it private and a lot
of it public, but not necessarily meant for each other to see. It is a
multudinous, inarticulate thing that we want out of all of this and that is
shared, at once, to some big vast other.
