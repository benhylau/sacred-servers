When the web emerged, it was treated as distinct from the real world, like we'd
discovered a second, imaginary earth. John Perry Barlow published the
"Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace", which said so in an official
decree: "Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and
steel, I come from Cyberspace, a new home of Mind...You are not welcome among
us...you have no sovereignty here."

He continued:

"I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent
of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us...Cyberspace does not lie within your
borders...it is an act of nature that grows through our collective actions. Your
legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not
apply to us...They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here."

We came to learn, of course, that this was hooey.

The online world is deeply entangled--inseparable--from our "real" world. The
cyber world he describes was, from the start, a military project. The things we
say and do online have a profound effect on our physical lives, and the
infrastructural needs have a profound effect on the natural world in which
cyberspace resides.

It is a compelling illusion to declare this a world with no matter, only Mind,
but it takes a whole lot of matter to maintain the illusion.

For a while it was a useful, semantic distinction for this internet place you
visited from the world in which you resided. That you were a different person in
"cyberspace" than in "meatspace". But the distinction makes little sense now,
cyberspace is more a nostalgic signifier than useful term, and "meatspace" is
really just for people who like saying "meat" out loud.

There is no separate space. We are all in it together, overlaid and coexisitent.
And, from my view, to declare a space of ideas and the mind to be necessarily
separate from the world, is to deny the world the aliveness, the agency, it has.
