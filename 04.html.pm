Liminal Spaces
}

Perhaps a part of the sacred well's power came from being a liminal space. It is
both land and water; a visible rush from an invisible source. We humans love
liminal spaces, recognize them as inherently powerful. The rush of emotions that
come at dusk and dawn, the symbolic depth felt when standing on the beach
looking out to the ocean. The electrical chill when someone is gone, but hasn't
yet left.

We are drawn to the inexpressible (or at least I am). The places beyond
articulation. And what pull there is for that which is not one thing or another,
but forever hovering in between.
