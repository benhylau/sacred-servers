# Sacred Servers Essay

This is an essay being written for [Compost Magazine](https://compost.digital).  


It is currently online in rough, unfinished form at https://coolguy.website/sacred-servers

In this repo you can read the source files that make up the essay. Click on tree to view them.

These are written in [pollen](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/), a book-publishing language.
It's intended to be v. readable as pure text, hopefully that is the case!

The essay is structured over multiple files, with the order of the files outlined in the file `index.ptree`.  
I recommend checking out that file first. Alternately, you can read the finished
site and for a page you want to edit, find its `name.html.pm` file in the repo.

Enjoy! Feedback v. welcome, and needed!
