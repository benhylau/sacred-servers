Servers and Data Centers
}

The spectrum of feelings we share on a handful of websites all end up travelling
to the same type of place: a server in some distant city owned by this same
handful.

When you message a friend it does not reach them directly. It is passed as a
request to a server beyond either of your control, and this server responds to
your request by, hopefully, passing it along. It will also keep this message
stored, for as long as it needs or wants to, in a data center owned by this
handful.

The message is translated to a language unspoken by us, a language reduced to an
extreme simplicity of 1 and 0, off and on, light and dark. Then it's translated
into energetic charge, recorded into a hard drive's platter as a sequence of
magnetized momemnts. Tiny, physical, but invisible points hold the requested
magnetic charge, this energetic impulse, for as long as needed...for in these
charged and uncharged points lives your words, ready to be recalled again.

What is passed along with everything we post? What all do these data centers
hold? Can our attachment to them come from something beyond addictive ui and a
massive budget...something it'd feel foolish to say aloud? What have we given
them, what power do they now hold? How much of what holds those pinpoints of a
hard drive in place is the words themsleves, and the inexpressible feelings
passed within them?
