A Sacred Well
}

In the spring of a while ago, during a trip to Ireland, I had the chance to
visit a sacred well. Sacred wells are pilgrimage sites–have been since
pre-Christian Ireland–with the pagan rituals adapting and persisting through new
Christian tradition.

The well was sheltered in a squat, stone hut, its entrance easy to spot by the
amount of _stuff_– bright, eclectic, dense stuff– crowded around it. The
interior was even more saturated in things, objects of worship (candles, saint's
medals) left behind by a past visitor, or sentimental objects with hinted
significance (a statue of a house, a person's photo in a frame, crutches) given
to the well to focus and amplify the visitor's prayer.

The traditions of the well weren't necessarily my traditions, but I felt the
reverence of the place immediately. I unconsciously took off my hat at the
entrance, walked softly down the passage way, past the candles, photos, toys,
and tightly folded papers holding letters not meant for any human to read.

The friends I was with all grew quiet as well, or rather it was as if a type
of profound quiet filled the place and we all followed its lead.

What was the source of that quiet? The source of the power and energy I felt
there? Was it given out by the well itself, felt fully by the first people to
discover it? Or was it a collaboration, an energy that accumulated with each
person, something left along with their object of intention, a hope trembling
and resonating with the sound of the water and the next believer's words? Were
we feeling that concentrated, intangible belief?
