Sacred and Profane
}

I will just say my feelings directly: we have given so much energy and intention
to a handful of centralized platforms, and I think it's become metaphysically
dangerous.

I don't think it's bad that we share what we do and as much as we do. It's
intense and beautiful and human. It's the same feelings we've always had, the
same need to share them, the same draw to inbetween spaces. We are just good at
adaptation. Liminal spaces is now and instagram account and a creepypasta.

It's dangerous because these platforms benefit from the energy held in their
centers, but treat it profanely. Our prayers and wishes are flattened alongside
everythign else, everything categorized as content. We cannot place our desires
into these spaces intentionally. They are cast to a feed and displayed
"algorithimically", which is to say mysteriously-- nestled between ads and banal
recaps of television shows. The amount of time you spend reading a loved one's
post is recorded by the platform to improve your advertising profile, so that
keywords in your friend's update on their sick dog will be used in some future
embedded post to sell you a subscription box for soap.

The data center require nature, but show no respect back to it. These centers
are placed strategically, aware of the power a particular landscape can hold.
They are giant buildings placed in out-of-sight spaces, but still connected to
our grid---giant buildings housing billions of humans posts, placed outside
towns of less than a thousand. Or they are placed in areas where the natural
landscape can help reduce their operating costs, near rivers that can be
directed to help power their cooling systems, or in mountains to protect against
the world-razing war they invariably expect.

There is something simple and pure in all that we share on these sites and the
power that this raises. And there is something simple and direct in how
profanely the platforms desecrate it.
