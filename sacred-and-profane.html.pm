Sacred and Profane
}

I will just say my feelings directly: we have given so much energy and intention
to a handful of centralized platforms, and I think it's become metaphysically
dangerous.

I don't think it's bad that we share what we do and as much as we do. It's
intense and beautiful and human. It's the same feelings we've always had, the
same need to pass them out beyond us we've always had, and we're good at
adaptation. Liminal spaces is now an instagram account ◊em{and} a creepypasta.

It's dangerous because these platforms use the energy held in their centers, but
treat it profanely. All our human experience shared at once is reduced to the
word "content". Our prayers and wishes are flattened alongside everythign else,
We cannot place them in these spaces intentionally--they are cast to a feed and
displayed "algorithimically", which is to say mysteriously, nestled between ads
and banal recaps of television shows. The amount of time you spend reading a
loved one's post is recorded by the company to adjust your advertising profile,
so that keywords in your friend's update on their sick dog will be used in some
future embedded post to sell you a subscription box for soap.

The data center require nature, but show no respect back to it. These centers
are placed strategically, aware of the power a particular landscape can hold.
They are giant buildings placed in out-of-sight spaces, but still connected to
our grid---giant buildings housing billions of humans posts, placed outside
towns of less than a thousand. Or they are placed in areas where the natural
landscape can help reduce their operating costs, near rivers that can be
directed to help power their cooling systems, or in mountains to protect against
the world-razing war they invariably expect.

There is something simple and pure in all that we share on these sites, and the
power that this raises, an attachment to each other that is tangible and
intangible both. And there is something simple and direct in how profanely the
platforms desecrate it.
