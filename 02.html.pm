Power in Place
}

There are the places and object that feel powerful because I am told they are
powerful. They are imbued with with belief, tradition, and history. And in these
places, my body responds appropriately-- a reflexive respect that brings my
voice to a whisper in a church, finds me taking off my shoes at the entrance of
a temple, ears pricked up for reverberation in the childhood home of a childhood
hero.

And there are the places and things that hold power for some small, or
inarticulate reason. Or, at least, If i were to try to articualte it, I'd feel
foolish. The one childhood toy I can't let go of, the town I irrationally hate
stopping at when travelling, when an item seems to "call" to me or when one
feels strangely "off". It's as if the things are filled with some energy of the
people before, a loop of time lingering in the space. It's that impulse that
comes whenever I move to a new home, no matter how bare, clean, and blank the
new space may be, to clean it all before we bring any of our own items in. What
are we cleaning? What invisible thing do we not want mingling with our own
invisible things?
